            <p class="description">
                Shield And Veil was created for a game designing course at DAE.
                Constrained by the keywords "Shield" and "Veil", I had to make 
                a prototype in Unreal Engine.
                The concept I came up with was a 3rd persone action-adventure game.
                You play as a knight that has to follow a path through a forest, 
                guarded by archers, to rescue the princess.
                The knight has multiple tools available: a sword, a shield and a veil.
                With the sword, you can kill an archer in close range.
                The shield allows the knight to block incoming arrows.
                The shield and veil however also exhibit a special ability: when 
                standing in a ray of sunshine that is peaking through the foliage, 
                the knight can reflect the ray and aim at guards to incinerate them,
                and the veil serves as a cload of invisibility.

                I had a very good time making this project, putting everything I had 
                previously learned while working with Unreal Engine to good use, and 
                refining my skills.
                I really enjoyed implementing the mechanic that reflects the ray of 
                sunshine, and working on the enemy behavior was the summit of the project.
