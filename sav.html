            <h5>About</h5>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Shield And Veil was created for a game designing course at DAE.
                Constrained by the keywords "Shield" and "Veil", I had to make a prototype in Unreal Engine.
                The concept I came up with was a 3rd persone action-adventure game.
                You play as a knight that has to follow a path through a forest, guarded by archers, to rescue the princess.
                The knight has multiple tools available: a sword, a shield and a veil.
                With the sword, you can kill an archer in close range.
                The shield allows the knight to block incoming arrows.
                The shield and veil however also exhibit a special ability: when standing in a ray of sunshine that is peaking through the foliage, the knight can reflect the ray and aim at guards to incinerate them, 
                and the veil serves as a cload of invisibility.
            </p>
            <h5>What I learned</h5>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I had a very good time making this project, putting everything I had previously learned while working with Unreal Engine to good use, and refining my skills.
                I really enjoyed implementing the mechanic that reflects the ray of sunshine, and working on the enemy behavior was the summit of the project.
